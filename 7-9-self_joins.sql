-- Modify the query from the previous video, which is pre-populated in the SQL Explorer below, to perform the same interval analysis except for the web_events table. Also:

-- change the interval to 1 day to find those web events that occurred after, but not more than 1 day after, another web event
-- add a column for the channel variable in both instances of the table in your query
-- You can find more on the types of INTERVALS (and other date related functionality) in the Postgres documentation here.
