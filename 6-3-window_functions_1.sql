-- Create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.

SELECT	standard_amt_usd, 
		SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders;

-- Now, modify your query from the previous quiz to include partitions. Still create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time, but this time, date truncate occurred_at by year and partition by that same year-truncated occurred_at variable. Your final table should have three columns: One with the amount being added for each row, one for the truncated date, and a final column with the running total within each year.

SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) as year,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd)
       		OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) ORDER BY occurred_at
       			) AS running_total
FROM orders;
